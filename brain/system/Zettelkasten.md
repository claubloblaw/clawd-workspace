# Zettelkasten

German for "slip box." A knowledge management method developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who used it to write 70+ books and 400+ papers.

## Core Principles

**Atomic notes** — One idea per note. If you can't state it clearly in isolation, split it.

**Unique IDs** — Every note gets a permanent address. Luhmann used numeric codes; we use filenames.

**Links over folders** — Notes connect to each other, not to categories. Structure emerges from connections.

**Write for your future self** — Notes should be complete thoughts, not fragments. You won't remember the context later.

## Why It Works

The magic isn't in storage — it's in retrieval and collision.

When you link notes, you create unexpected juxtapositions. Ideas from different contexts meet. The system thinks *with* you, surfacing connections you wouldn't have made.

Luhmann called his Zettelkasten a "conversation partner."

## For Agents

Zettelkasten maps almost directly to agent knowledge systems:

| Zettelkasten | Agent Brain |
|--------------|-------------|
| Slip (Zettel) | Markdown file |
| Unique ID | Filename |
| Links | Wiki-links `[[]]` |
| Folgezettel (sequences) | MOCs |
| Index | File tree + descriptions |

Key difference: Luhmann was the operator. Here, [[agents can bootstrap their own tools]] — the agent both uses and extends the system.

## Limitations

- **Requires discipline** — Easy to create junk notes
- **Slow to start** — Value compounds over time
- **Human-paced** — Designed for one brain, not parallel processing

Agents can address the third limitation via [[subagents enable parallel specialized work]].
