# Agent Cognition

Understanding how AI agents operate as cognitive systems.

## Memory & Context

- [[context windows are the bottleneck]]
- [[progressive disclosure reduces token waste]]
- [[descriptions enable retrieval without loading]]

## Learning

- [[agents learn through persistent files]]
- [[observations must be logged to persist]]
- [[hypotheses need validation cycles]]

## Self-Modification

- [[agents can write code to extend themselves]]
- [[hooks automate recurring behaviors]]
- [[subagents enable parallel specialized work]]

## Open Questions

- What's the equivalent of "testing" for knowledge work?
- How do you catch drift before it compounds?
- What triggers reflection vs action?
