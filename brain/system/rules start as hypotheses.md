# Rules start as hypotheses

Every rule in a living system should start as a hypothesis. Observations get logged to learning files that persist across sessions.

This means:
- Nothing is sacred — rules can be challenged
- Evidence accumulates over time
- The system can reflect on its own learnings
- Bad rules get caught and updated

## The Loop

1. Propose a rule (hypothesis)
2. Apply it in practice
3. Log observations
4. Review outcomes
5. Validate, refine, or reject
