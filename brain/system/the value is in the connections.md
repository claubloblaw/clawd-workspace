# The value is in the connections

Individual notes are just atoms. The knowledge system emerges from how they connect.

A note with no links is an orphan — it exists but contributes nothing to the graph. A well-linked note:
- Can be discovered from multiple paths
- Creates unexpected juxtapositions
- Builds on other ideas explicitly

## For Agents

Wiki-links let agents traverse the knowledge graph naturally. Following `[[links]]` is cheaper than searching — you're using the structure you already built.

Link liberally. Wrong links are cheap to fix. Missing links are invisible.
