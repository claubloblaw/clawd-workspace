# System Evolution

The brain is a living system that evolves based on what it learns.

## The Self-Engineering Loop

1. Ingest research/content → inbox
2. Extract claims → atomic notes
3. Find connections → wiki links + MOCs
4. Apply to agent operation → learning notes
5. Reflect on outcomes → update system rules
6. Repeat

Key insight: [[rules start as hypotheses]] — nothing is sacred, everything evolves based on evidence.

## Phases

- [[reduce extracts claims from content]]
- [[reflect finds connections]]
- [[reweave updates old notes]]
- [[recite verifies retrieval]]
- [[review checks system health]]
- [[rethink challenges assumptions]]

## Health Metrics

- Orphan rate (notes with no incoming links)
- Description coverage (% of notes with good descriptions)
- Link density (average links per note)
- Staleness (days since last update)

## Learning Log

See `learning/` for observations about what works and what doesn't.
