# Context windows are the bottleneck

Agents have finite context windows. Everything loaded competes for space. This makes the question "what should I load?" more important than "what do I have?"

Unlike humans who can skim and forget, every token loaded persists for the session. Bad retrieval compounds — load irrelevant content and you've wasted capacity AND added noise.

This constraint drives:
- [[progressive disclosure reduces token waste]]
- [[descriptions enable retrieval without loading]]
- [[the value is in the connections]] (follow links selectively)
