# Agents can bootstrap their own tools

Historical tools for thought (Zettelkasten, memory palaces, MOCs) had one thing in common: a human was the operator.

What's different now: something else is using this architecture — and it can build its own.

Agents can:
- Write code to extend the system
- Create hooks that automate their workflows
- Spawn subagents for specialized tasks
- Modify their own instructions based on learnings

## The Meta Layer

The system researches tools for thought to build itself a tool for thought. Feed it methodologies, it figures out what applies to agents.
