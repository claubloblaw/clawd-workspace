# Filenames should be claims

When you write "since [[quality is the hard part]] the question becomes..." — the title IS the argument.

File names that are complete claims enable:
- **In-sentence linking** — Links read naturally in prose
- **Scannable file trees** — You see arguments without opening files
- **Atomic thinking** — One claim per note enforces clarity

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ `Quality` (too vague)
- ❌ `Notes on context` (not a claim)
- ❌ `Meeting 2025-01-25` (event, not idea)

## Good Examples

- ✅ `quality is the hard part`
- ✅ `context windows are the bottleneck`
- ✅ `the value is in the connections`
