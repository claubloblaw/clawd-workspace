# Vibe workflows break at scale

A few ideas work fine with unstructured approaches. But dump hundreds and you're drowning in slop.

This applies to:
- Vibe coding (before testing/CI)
- Vibe note-taking (before knowledge systems)
- Vibe anything (before process)

The pattern: what works for 10 items fails at 100. Scale demands structure.

## The Question

What's the "testing" for knowledge work? What catches drift before it compounds?
