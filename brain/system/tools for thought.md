# Tools for Thought

Humans have built external systems to think with for centuries. These inform how agents should structure knowledge.

## Historical Systems

- [[Llull's combinatorial wheels]]
- [[Bruno's memory palaces]]
- [[Zettelkasten]]

## Modern Methods

- [[evergreen notes]]
- [[maps of content]]
- [[progressive summarization]]
- [[Cornell notes 5Rs framework]]

## Key Principles

- [[the value is in the connections]]
- [[atomic notes force clear thinking]]
- [[retrieval beats storage]]
- [[filenames should be claims]]
- [[vibe workflows break at scale]]

## Agent Adaptations

- [[wiki links are knowledge graph edges]]
- [[YAML frontmatter enables filtering]]
- [[file trees are claim inventories]]
- [[markdown files are graph databases]]
- [[agents can bootstrap their own tools]]

## Open Questions

- Which human methods don't translate to agents?
- What can agents do that humans can't?
- How does infinite patience change the calculus?
