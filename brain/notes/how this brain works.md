# How this brain works

## Structure

```
brain/
├── inbox/     # Dump ideas, articles, thoughts here
├── notes/     # Atomic notes (one idea = one file)
├── mocs/      # Maps of Content (index pages)
├── learning/  # Observations and lessons
├── system/    # Meta stuff about the brain itself
└── archive/   # Processed sources, old stuff
```

## The Loop

1. **Capture** → Dump into inbox (don't organize yet)
2. **Process** → Extract claims into notes, link to MOCs
3. **Connect** → Add wiki-links between related ideas
4. **Review** → Periodically check what's stale or orphaned

## Conventions

- **Filenames are claims** — Write them as complete thoughts
- **YAML descriptions** — One sentence summary at top of each note
- **Link liberally** — Connections are the value
- **MOCs as entry points** — Start from [[home]], drill down

## For Claub

When processing inbox items, extract distinct claims as separate notes. Update relevant MOCs. Don't over-engineer — the goal is Marcel's success, not a perfect system.

See `system/` folder for methodology notes (Zettelkasten, etc.) — reference material, not daily use.
