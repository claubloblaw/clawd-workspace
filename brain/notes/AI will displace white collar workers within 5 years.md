# AI will displace white collar workers within 5 years

This is a strong, specific belief — not hedge-y "AI might change things."

## The Thesis

- Pressure to reduce costs + increase profits will drive adoption
- White collar workers will be replaced by AI
- SWE role transforms into "orchestrating agents"
- Fewer devs needed overall
- Timeline: by ~2030

## Implications (to explore)

**For labor markets:**
- Mass unemployment in knowledge work?
- Which roles go first? Which are resilient?
- What happens to consumer spending if white collar income drops?

**For companies:**
- Who benefits? (AI infrastructure, picks & shovels)
- Who gets margin expansion? (Companies that can replace workers)
- Who gets disrupted? (Service companies selling human labor)

**For Marcel personally:**
- Is Sitecore Architect role at risk?
- What's the hedge? (Become the orchestrator, not the orchestrated)
- How does this affect career decisions?

**For investing:**
- Long AI infrastructure? (Nvidia, cloud, tooling)
- Long companies that will automate? (High labor cost businesses)
- Short labor-heavy service companies?
- Wait for the "displacement recession" to buy?

## Open Questions

- What's the trigger to deploy capital?
- How to express this thesis in a portfolio?
- Is waiting for a crash the right move, or just market timing?
