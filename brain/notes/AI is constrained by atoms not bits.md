# AI is constrained by atoms not bits

Everyone is long AI software. But AI scaling requires:

- **Energy** — Data centers are power-hungry, grid capacity is limited
- **Chips** — Fab capacity is constrained, lead times are long
- **Copper** — Electrification + data centers = massive demand
- **Raw materials** — Rare earths, lithium, etc.

## The Contrarian View

AI is real. The transformation is real. But **current valuations assume scaling that physical constraints may not allow.**

Reputable people have made compelling cases that reality doesn't match aspirations.

## Possible Plays

Instead of "buy AI companies," consider:

- **Energy infrastructure** — Utilities building grid capacity, natural gas, nuclear
- **Materials** — Copper miners, rare earth suppliers
- **Picks & shovels (physical)** — The atoms that enable the bits

## The Deflation Angle

Simultaneously: if AI succeeds, intelligence becomes cheap → strong deflationary pressure → many things become cheaper when human labor isn't needed.

This creates a weird scenario:
- Short term: Resource constraints limit AI scaling, bubble corrects
- Long term: AI wins, deflation, fewer jobs, but cheaper everything

## Open Questions

- When does the constraint reality hit valuations?
- What's the right timing to shift from "atoms" to "AI winners"?
- How to play the deflation scenario?
