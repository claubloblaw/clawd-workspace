# Life

The non-work stuff that matters.

## Health

Body, energy, longevity.

- 

## Relationships

People who matter.

- 

## Practices

Daily/weekly habits that work.

- 

## Values

What I actually care about (not what I say I care about).

- 

## Open Questions

- Am I spending time on what matters?
- What would I regret not doing?
