# Lab

The abstract stuff. Ideas worth exploring even if they don't have immediate practical value.

## Agent Cognition

How agents think, learn, verify, and improve.

- [[back pressure tests agent work]]
- [[what is the test for knowledge work]]

## Tools for Thought

How humans (and agents) build external systems to think with.

- See `system/` for methodology notes (Zettelkasten, etc.)

## Open Research Questions

From Heinrich's thread and beyond:

- What catches drift before it compounds?
- What's the equivalent of "testing" for knowledge work?
- How do agents verify their own outputs?
- What can agents do that humans can't (and vice versa)?
