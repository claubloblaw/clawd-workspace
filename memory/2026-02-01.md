# 2026-02-01 Daily Notes

## Session Recovery (post-compaction)
- Context compacted mid-session — lost conversation history
- Marcel asked to set up RULES.md for tracking mistakes/lessons ✅
- Marcel asked to research context window management strategies ✅

## What Was Set Up
1. **RULES.md** — Created at workspace root. Tracks mistakes, lessons learned, process rules.
2. **MEM** — Created long-term memory file with key facts about Marcel, active projects, preferences.
3. **AGENTS.md** — Updated to include RULES.md in session startup checklist.
4. **Context management strategy** documented in RULES.md:
   - Periodic state checkpoints every 10-15 exchanges
   - Proactive `/compact` with good instructions
   - Don't rely solely on auto memory flush

## Issues Found
- **bird CLI** is timing out on all commands (whoami, search, bookmarks, check). Auth tokens may be stale or there's a network issue.
- **memory_search** is disabled — no OpenAI or Gemini API key configured for embeddings. Need to set one up.
- **Brave Search API** not configured — `web_search` tool unavailable.

## TODO
- Fix bird CLI auth/connectivity
- Configure memory search embeddings (OpenAI or Gemini API key)
- Configure Brave Search API key
- Find the X post Marcel mentioned about context serialization strategies
- Marcel mentioned GitHub auth issues earlier — those were resolved (gh CLI now authed as claubloblaw)

## Prior Session Context (from memory files)
- WP plugin audit for Nova Psychology site (Jan 31)
- Investment/market timing research (Jan 25-27)
- Clawdbot initial setup and Opus model switch (Jan 25)
