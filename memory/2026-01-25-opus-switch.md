## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✓ Obsidian vault created at `~/clawd/vault`

**Setup complete:**
- Vault registered + set as default
- Created `Home.md` starter note
- `.obsidian/` config folder initialized

**Next steps:**
- Open vault in Obsidian app: `open obsidian://vault/vault`
- Or manage via CLI: `obsidian-cli create "Note Name"`
- Direct file edits work too — just create `.md` files in the vault

Want me to add anything else to the vault (templates, daily note structure, etc)?
user: switch to opus mdel
