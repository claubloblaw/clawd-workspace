## Conversation Summary

user: let's update your model to use opus 4.5
[message_id: f82970db-c8f5-4060-85c1-8a15be1c089c]
assistant: Done! Updated the primary model to `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`. The gateway should hot-reload the config, but if not, you may need to restart for the model switch to take effect on new sessions.
user: did it work?
[message_id: 77c84221-bc0c-453d-9209-2effbecfcc84]
assistant: Yes! I'm now running on **Claude Opus 4.5**. 🎉

The switch was successful - no restart needed, it hot-reloaded.
