2026-02-21: Scraper failing since ~Feb 20 8pm. "Could not switch to List view" on realtor.ca. Likely UI change or bot detection. Last successful run: raw-2026-02-20T21-00-04.json. Needs investigation — try updating the List view selector or using API interception on map view directly.
2026-02-21 20:00: Root cause confirmed — realtor.ca Incapsula/Imperva bot detection is blocking ALL requests from the OpenClaw browser. Even homepage returns "Request unsuccessful". Need to either: (1) clear browser data/cookies and retry, (2) switch to direct API calls with proper headers, or (3) use a residential proxy. Browser fingerprint is likely flagged.
