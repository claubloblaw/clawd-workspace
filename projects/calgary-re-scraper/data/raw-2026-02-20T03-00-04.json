Oversized windows pour in natural light, creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere throughout. Upstairs, a stunning vaulted bonus room offers the perfect space for movie nights, a play zone, or simply relaxing in style. Safe & Sound insulation throughout the interior walls enhances privacy and quiet.Outside, the backyard feels like a private retreat.

Raised garden beds await green thumbs, while the fully finished playhouse is insulated, heated, and powered. Parking is exceptional with a 42-foot driveway, plus an additional 61 feet of RV, boat, or heavy equipment parking along the side with front street access, and extra covered parking beneath the deck. The oversized double garage features a 9’ door, 12’ ceilings, and full insulation. Durable rubberized Malarkey shingles come with warranty coverage through 2040, and a 16,000-watt Generac automatic generator keeps the entire home powered no matter the weather. (31664355)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Blending functionality and charm, the Sutton is a welcoming home designed for real life—equally perfect for entertaining friends or settling in for a cozy night at home. The open-concept main floor feels bright and spacious, featuring luxury vinyl plank flooring throughout, quartz countertops, and a warm electric fireplace that anchors the living space. The classic L-shaped kitchen is as practical as it is polished, with a central island for prep and gatherings, plus a kitchen window overlooking the backyard—ideal for keeping an eye on kids, pets, or the BBQ while you cook. A walk-in butler’s pantry adds the “everything-but-the-butler” convenience: well-lit, organized storage just steps from where you’ll need it most. Daily routines are made easier with a rear mudroom complete with additional storage and built-in lockers—perfect for shoes, backpacks, coats, and all the little essentials that tend to pile up. A modern wood railing and statement slat-wall detail add bold style in all the right places, creating an eye-catching focal point while still keeping safety and function front of mind. Upstairs, the thoughtful layout continues with a central bonus room that creates a comfortable buffer between the primary suite and the secondary bedrooms—giving everyone space to spread out, connect, or unwind. The winged bedroom configuration enhances privacy, while second-floor laundry keeps day-to-day living efficient. The primary bedroom feels like a true retreat with a vestibule-style entrance and a spacious ensuite offering a dual vanity and a wet room option—bringing spa-worthy comfort to your everyday. A 9’ foundation adds valuable lower-level height and flexibility, and the home is solar ready with 200-amp service, a 64-panel breaker, and conduit roughed-in to the roof—built with the future in mind. Enjoy outdoor living with a deck already in place, ready for summer dinners and relaxed evenings. Set in Calgary’s “new west,” Alpine Park is designed around New Urbanist pri nciples—meaning walkability, people-first streetscapes, and a community layout built to encourage connection. At the heart of it all is the planned Village Centre, envisioned as an amenity core with everyday conveniences (think grocery/pharmacy and more) plus places to linger like restaurants and coffee spots—intentionally planned so many daily needs are within an easy walk. The community also highlights design touches like couplet roads that help diffuse traffic and support a more comfortable, walkable feel, along with parks and green connections such as Midway Park that link the Village Centre through the neighbourhood. And when you do want to get out and explore, Alpine Park’s location pairs quick access to Calgary via Stoney Trail with easy escapes toward nature—plus Fish Creek Provincial Park is close by for walks, rides, and weekend resets. **Photos are from the show home/previous builds to demonstrate quality of construction & finishes and may not be an exact representation of this home** (31658740)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Tucked away on a quiet cul-de-sac in sought-after McKenzie Lake, this beautifully updated home offers the perfect blend of comfort, function, and location. Just steps from the ridge above Fish Creek and the Bow River pathways, you’ll enjoy easy access to nature along with stunning mountain and partial city views from home. Inside, the bright open-concept layout connects the living, dining, and kitchen areas- ideal for everyday living and entertaining. Fresh paint and new carpets (2022) create a clean, modern feel, while the recently updated main-floor laundry adds everyday convenience. Upstairs features a spacious primary retreat with an ensuite, plus two additional bedrooms, including one oversized room. Major upgrades include triple-pane windows throughout and double-pane skylights (2023), Poly-B replacement (2023), and a new roof, air conditioning, and appliances (2022). The oversized garage provides excellent storage or workshop space, and the sunny south-facing backyard offers a new pad (2025) and exterior hot water tap. Surrounded by playgrounds, close to amenities, and set in a quiet cul-de-sac, this move-in-ready home is a rare find in one of Calgary’s most desirable lake communities. (31663562)",

      "PublicRemarks": "IF YOU’VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A MOVE-UP HOME THAT ACTUALLY FEELS WORTH IT, HERE IT IS.This Hemsworth model in Vermilion Hill delivers four bedrooms and three full baths — including a MAIN-FLOOR BEDROOM with a fully tiled shower that makes multi-generational living, long-term guests, or a private office feel completely natural.Now let’s talk about the heart of the home — because it deserves your attention.The kitchen delivers exactly what a move-up should: a GAS COOKTOP, BUILT-IN WALL OVEN, and CHIMNEY HOOD FAN backed by tile to the ceiling, paired with tall cabinetry, pot drawers where they belong, and quartz surfaces that elevate everyday life. A WALKTHROUGH PANTRY connects directly to the mudroom and garage entry — keeping groceries, backpacks, and real-life mess moving quietly out of sight.Upstairs is where this home really opens up. The BONUS ROOM anchors the level, while the OPEN-TO-BELOW design looks over the two-storey great room and its FULL-HEIGHT FIREPLACE FEATURE WALL — a vertical moment that adds scale and drama you simply don’t expect. The primary retreat delivers a true five-piece ensuite with DUAL SINKS, a DEEP SOAKER TUB, and a TILE-AND-GLASS SHOWER, flowing into a walk-in closet that connects directly to the laundry room (because someone was thinking about real life). And the secondary bedrooms? Both come with walk-in closets — no afterthoughts here.And then there’s the SUNSHINE BASEMENT. Nine-foot foundation walls, large windows and a SEPARATE EXTERIOR ENTRY create light and space that’s ready for whatever your next chapter looks like — extended family, future development, or the flexibility you’ve been craving.Vermilion Hill is one of Calgary’s newest southwest communities, defined by BIG-SKY VIEWS, cohesive architecture, and streetscapes designed to feel polished from the start. Wide boulevards, planned parks, and connected pathways create a neighbourhood that already feels established rather than pieced together, with QUICK ACCESS TO  MAJOR ROUTES and everyday amenities. And its DARK SKY DESIGNATION preserves those clear, starlit evenings — a rare touch in a new Calgary neighbourhood.IMMEDIATE POSSESSION means no waiting — just a move-up home that makes you glad you did. Call your agent and BOOK A SHOWING, you’ll thank me later. • PLEASE NOTE: Photos are of another spec home of the same model – fit & finish may differ.

      "PublicRemarks": "Built in the best CUL-DE-SAC in Mahogany and one of the initial phases in the community, this JAYMAN home gives you EASY IN-AND-OUT ACCESS. It's only a hop, skip and jump to the WEST BEACH - Local Mahogany residents tend to say \"The West Beach is the Best Beach\" and you're going to be Oh' so close. Mahogany's AWESOMENESS FACTOR is backed by being awarded a SIX-TIME COMMUNITY OF THE YEAR and still one of Calgary’s most celebrated communities to date. Buying a home is cool, but buying a home in desirable location, well, that's even better.What does this home offer me, you ask? How about a smart open concept layout featuring HIGH CEILINGS, natural lighting, elevated construction materials (NO VINYL SIDING to see here friends), and PLENTY OF SPACE for real life — the best recipe for dinner with friends, the epic block party or weekend lounging.The LARGE KITCHEN and eat-in island are made for hosting, cooking, and gathering. Upstairs, the primary bedroom is spacious and practical with aHUGE WALK-IN CLOSET, and large SOAKER TUB. There are two additional bedrooms and a PRIVATE BALCONY on the upper level — the perfect bonusspot for fresh air and a place to spy on the neighbours. When it's so cold outside and it makes your face hurt, no biggie because you will now have a HEATED GARAGE. This is exactly the kind of feature you’ll thank yourself for every winter morning, and it will make all your friends jealous. #WINNING. Downstairs, the FINISHED BASEMENT adds another bedroom and full bathroom, making it a great setup for guests, that delightful teenager you may have, or extended family. Have a peek at the replaced hot water tank in 2024 and already installed WATER SOFTENER. Now for the bonus room - that’s your wildcard space — movie nights, a playroom, a home gym, or the ultimate hobby zone.  YOU GET TO CHOOSE. Doesn't CHOICE sound nice?Now let’s talk lifestyle; living in Mahogany means you’re steps from a wondrous LAKE-VIEW WALKING promenade and endless PATHWAYS aro und the WETLANDS making them the perfect spot to capture your annual family portrait.  Most importantly, you will have YEAR-ROUND LAKE ACCESS. That'll turn some heads. The BEACH CLUB offers everything from tennis courts, paddle boarding, skating, splash parks, playgrounds and organized programs ad events. Basically… there’s always something to do, or not - I get it. Living here will situate you close to schools, boutique shops, restaurants, Seton YMCA and the South Health Campus. The quick access to Stoney Trail and Deerfoot will shorten your drive time, which means more time in sweatpants with snacks. So, what do you say?So whatcha say?  Ready to MOVE IN, SETTLE DOWN, and start enjoying everything MAHOGANY has to offer.                 LET'S DO THIS. (31652016)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Welcome to 375 Douglas Glen Gardens SE, a beautifully designed 2,298 sq. ft. residence tucked away in a quiet cul-de-sac in one of Calgary’s most desirable communities. Perfectly situated near Quarry Park and the scenic Bow River pathways, this home offers the best of both convenience and lifestyle. Just minutes from public transportation, the YMCA, daycare centres, the public library, grocery stores, and a wide variety of restaurants, it provides everything a family could want right at their doorstep. From the moment you step inside, the open-concept design invites you in with an effortless flow between the kitchen, dining area, and living room. Expansive windows flood the main floor with natural light, while an impressive 18-foot vaulted ceiling enhances the sense of space and elegance. The kitchen is a true centre piece, featuring a spacious nook, pantry, and the warmth of a gas fireplace nearby. Galaxy Black granite countertops extend throughout the entire home, adding a touch of sophistication to every room. A convenient half bathroom, a full laundry room with upper cabinets and premium LG washer and dryer, and a large family room designed for gatherings make the main floor as functional as it is inviting. From here, you can step directly onto the 8’ x 18’ deck, perfect for outdoor entertaining or enjoying peaceful evenings. Upstairs, you’ll find three generously sized bedrooms and a versatile built-in workstation, ideal for a home office or study space for children. The primary suite is a private retreat, complete with a spa-inspired en-suite that features dual sinks, a stand-up shower, a double jetted jacuzzi tub, and a walk-in closet. It is a space designed for both relaxation and practicality. The lower level of the home remains undeveloped, offering a blank canvas for your personal vision—whether that be a home theatre, gym, additional living quarters, or a recreational space. Practicality extends beyond the interior with a spacious double attached garage  and an additional custom-built 8’ x 18’ shed, perfect for storing ATVs, bikes, or garden equipment(removable). Recent updates include a new upgraded 50-gallon hot water tank and a new dishwasher, adding peace of mind for future owners. The home is also equipped with an alarm system featuring motion sensors and door contacts for added security. This property offers a rare combination of thoughtful design, desirable location, and future potential. With its proximity to nature, amenities, and family-friendly conveniences, 375 Douglas Glen Gardens SE is more than just a home—it’s a lifestyle. (31654021)",

      "PublicRemarks": "First time on MLS! Amazingly solid and well built, classic mid century home by JAEGER Homes is awaiting a new family. Located on a quiet street on a 55 foot lot, in the heart of Fairview, this classic, impeccably MAINTAINED home has many unique features. The main floor has a traditional 'L' shaped living and dining room plan with gorgeous oak HARDWOOD throughout. A good sized kitchen is adjacent to the dining room with a STEEL SUPPORT BEAM running though the bulkhead separating the two areas, which can be helpful for future reno plans. The upper level has 2 bedrooms with hardwood and a full bath. A few steps down from the main floor is the WALKOUT level, with a door to the backyard, and 2 bedrooms. The basement level contains a large living area, bath with shower, a SECOND KITCHEN area (the seller had used it as a summer kitchen), laundry and storage. The spacious back yard is a great place to relax with the poured concrete patio and gazebo ready for summer BBQs. A 21' x10' foot GREENHOUSE can be HEATED from the garage furnace and will turn you into an instant green thumb. Built for LONGEVITY, the oversized, heated, double garage is solid and is constructed from cinderblock filled with concrete. Its a mechanic's dream allowing for comfortable year round use. Older homes in this condition rarely come along. Contact your favourite agent to set up a private showing. (31663830)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Welcome to 143 Masters Link SE – where style, light, and thoughtful design converge in the award-winning lake community of Mahogany.

The main level showcases new luxury vinyl plank flooring and a bright, spacious living room that easily accommodates a large sectional and invites family and friends to gather. Transition effortlessly into the chef-inspired kitchen, where an oversized central island with dual waterfall granite edges becomes the showpiece. Complete with stainless steel appliances, pendant lighting, full tile backsplash, and a convenient pantry, this kitchen blends sophistication and practicality. The expanded dining area, highlighted by yet another soaring ceiling, creates the perfect atmosphere for dinners bathed in natural light; while a discreet half bath completes this level. Upstairs, discover three generous bedrooms and two full bathrooms, including a tranquil primary retreat featuring a four-piece ensuite and a large walk-in closet. Downstairs, the almost fully finished lower level continues to impress. With its open recreation room, a convenient office nook for remote work or study, and expansive storage and laundry areas, the design ensures comfort and functionality. Thanks to the open-to-below layout, even this level feels bright and connected. Outside, the stucco exterior adds refined curb appeal, while the large rear deck is perfect for BBQs, entertaining, or simply relaxing under the evening sky. The oversized double detached garage offers ample space and convenient lane access. Situated in the vibrant community of Mahogany, residents enjoy exclusive access to the lake, year-round recreation, scenic trails and ponds, and a lively mix of shops, cafés,  and amenities—all within walking distance.

      "PublicRemarks": "Welcome to an incredible opportunity in the community of Dover! Step into your dream home, a unique Bungalow offering 1410 sq ft of living space on the main floor and 1278 sq ft of developed space in the basement. The original structure received a 378 sq ft front addition in 1989, fully compliant with the City of Calgary Planning and Building Regulations and completed by a qualified contractor. With its solid poured concrete footing and treated wood foundation walls (only on the addition portion of the house), this home is structurally sound and brimming with potential for a full renovation to make it your own.  The main floor features a grand living room with a stone-faced wood-burning fireplace and plentiful windows that flood the space with light. The kitchen, renovated in 1989, is due for an update but remains in great condition. The open floor plan includes two bedrooms, each with a 3-piece ensuite. The Primary Bedroom’s ensuite requires some enclosure, while the second bedroom boasts sliding patio doors that lead to the backyard balcony and in-ground outdoor pool.  The basement offers three bedrooms, two of which are part of the 1989 addition and feature larger windows (not egress). Also included is a gas-burning fireplace, a storage room, and a 4-piece bathroom. The well-insulated 378 sq ft addition spans both the basement and the main floor.  Outdoor amenities include a backyard with a natural gas line for the BBQ and firepit, an in-ground outdoor pool winterized in the fall of 2024 and sold \"AS IS WHERE IS,\" a double detached garage (20ft x 24ft), and an additional carport or RV parking spot. Imagine your family enjoying summer days by the pool, a place filled with laughter and memories for family, friends, and grandchildren.  Notable upgrades include a water tank installed in 2015, a roof replaced in 2010, and all windows replaced during the 1989 renovation. The furnace is in great condition, though it is unclear if it is original or replaced.  Schedule a  viewing with your licensed agent who can help you envision creative changes to make this space your own. This home has been lovingly cared for and is ready for its next chapter with a new family. Don’t miss out—book your showing today! (31643307)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Tucked on a quiet street in Somerset, this move-in-ready home pairs standout curb appeal with a thoughtfully updated interior and a backyard built for Calgary summers.From the moment you arrive, the stone walkway and welcoming front porch set the tone, complemented by durable Hardie board siding and warm exterior lighting. Inside, a modern open-concept layout feels bright and polished with flat smooth ceilings, pot lights, updated window trim/baseboards, and hardwood flooring throughout the main level. The cozy living room flows seamlessly into the kitchen, featuring espresso cabinetry, granite countertops, and stainless steel appliances, plus a dining area perfectly positioned for everyday life and entertaining.Convenience is built in with a main-floor laundry room and a 2-piece powder room, completing the functional layout on the main level.Step outside to your private, south-facing backyard—a true retreat—complete with a two-tier, rope-lit deck, pergola, mature trees, and vibrant gardens. A newer wired shed offers extra flexibility (and can be tied into the garage), while the real showstopper is the oversized, insulated double detached garage—heated with gas and equipped with 220V wiring—ideal for a workshop, hobby space, or serious storage.Upstairs you’ll find three generous bedrooms, including a primary suite with a 4-piece ensuite, plus an additional 4-piece main bath. As a unique bonus, the fully finished attic space (accessed by pull-down ladder) adds valuable square footage—perfect for a home office, creative studio, guest space, or organized storage—with an additional large closet up there as well.The fully finished basement is designed for comfort and hosting, featuring a spacious family room with a floor-to-ceiling stone gas fireplace, a wet bar with granite counters, and a 3-piece bathroom with granite finishes. A large utility/furnace room rounds out the lower level with even more storage.Notables include shingles + furnace replaced in 2019 and a  new garage in 2022—big-ticket items already handled. Hot water tank original.  Location is the final advantage. Somerset is loved for its excellent access to transit (including the CTrain), parks and pathways, and an active outdoor lifestyle—playgrounds, green spaces, tennis courts and fields, a splash/water park, picnic spots, and a toboggan hill—all close by. You’re also minutes to schools, shopping, services, and healthcare, making day-to-day life easy. (31638731)",

      "PublicRemarks": "This bright and airy bi-level home in the heart of McKenzie Lake offers a perfectly functional layout highlighted by soaring vaulted ceilings and a seamless open-concept main floor. The spacious living area flows into a well-appointed kitchen, while two generously sized bedrooms—including a primary suite with a walk-in closet—and a 4-piece bathroom complete the upper level. Downstairs, the fully finished basement feels like anything but a lower level thanks to massive south-facing windows that flood the large living area and dedicated flex space with natural light. This level also features a third bedroom, a 3-piece bathroom, a laundry room, and ample storage. Step outside to your private, south-facing backyard, complete with a firepit for evening gatherings and a double detached garage with an adjacent parking pad. Ideally located just minutes from top-rated schools like McKenzie Lake Elementary and Cardinal Newman, as well as the extensive shopping and dining options at 130th Ave and the stunning pathways of Fish Creek Provincial Park, this home offers the perfect balance of comfort and convenience.

      "PublicRemarks": "A brand new opportunity in Hotchkiss, this thoughtfully designed home by Broadview offers an open-concept main floor, an upstairs loft, and a side entrance with basement rough-ins in place for future development. The covered front porch welcomes you into a bright main level, with the kitchen positioned at the back of the home and centered around a spacious island, ample cabinetry, and seamless connection to the dining area and great room. A convenient powder room completes the main floor, ideal for everyday living and entertaining. Upstairs, a central loft creates valuable bonus space that can serve as a second lounge, home office, or study area. Two additional bedrooms, a full bathroom, and an upper laundry room provide practical convenience, while the primary suite features a walk-in closet and an ensuite with dual vanities. With direct basement access from the side entrance and rough-ins already completed, the lower level offers excellent potential for additional living space as your needs evolve. Located in southeast Calgary’s growing community of Hotchkiss, residents enjoy access to scenic pathways, green space, and the 30-acre wetland, with quick connections to Stoney Trail, Seton shopping, the YMCA, and South Health Campus.

      "PublicRemarks": "Meet the brand-new “Heath,” a fresh take on a beloved layout that blends smart design with everyday comfort—now in Hotchkiss. Step inside to a bright, open main floor finished in warm luxury vinyl plank, with a versatile front flex room that’s perfect for a home office, homework zone, or cozy reading nook. The rear of the home opens up beautifully to an inviting living room and an oversized dining area—ideal for weeknight dinners, hosting friends, and everything in between. At the heart of it all, the chef-inspired kitchen delivers the look buyers love: wood-grain cabinetry extended to the bulkhead, crisp white quartz countertops, a timeless subway tile backsplash, stainless steel appliances, a convenient microwave-over-the-range, and a large island that makes prep, snacks, and conversation effortless. A generous rear window pulls in great natural light, and the practical back entry keeps daily comings and goings organized and easy. Upstairs, a centrally located loft creates a true second living space—perfect as a TV zone, play area, or quiet spot to unwind—while also providing smart separation between bedrooms. The spacious primary retreat includes a walk-in closet and a spa-inspired 4-piece ensuite with dual sinks. Two additional bedrooms are nicely sized and share a well-appointed 4-piece bath, while the upper laundry room keeps chores convenient (and out of sight). A side/secondary entrance adds valuable flexibility for future possibilities like a guest space, in-law setup, or private lower-level living area (subject to city/municipal approvals and permitting). Outside, the landscaping is complete—front and back—so you can enjoy the home from day one, with finished sod, mulched side yards, and thoughtfully selected trees and shrubs that elevate curb appeal. And the setting ties it all together. Hotchkiss is designed around wide-open skies, connected green spaces, and everyday convenience—highlighted by a central wetland with boardwalks and a planned network of p arks and pathways. You’ll love the quick access to major routes like Stoney Trail and 22X, plus nearby shopping, schools, and amenities, with Seton and the South Health Campus just minutes away. From morning walks to relaxed evenings at home, the Heath in Hotchkiss offers a lifestyle that’s easy to settle into and hard to outgrow. (31635508)",

      "PublicRemarks": "OPEN HOUSE - Sat Feb 21, 1:00-3:00 - Welcome to your bright and breezy family haven in Woodbine—where comfort, style, and practicality all decided to move in together....Step inside to a main floor that feels instantly welcoming, with vaulted ceilings and a beautiful bay window that drenches the living room in natural light. Rich hardwood flooring leads you into the dining area, where a modern chandelier sets the mood and an impressive stone-faced fireplace adds both warmth and a touch of drama....The updated kitchen is ready for both everyday meals and weekend entertaining, featuring stainless steel appliances and a raised breakfast bar that overlooks the dining room—perfect for chatting with guests or supervising homework while you cook....Head upstairs to find three generously sized bedrooms. The serene primary retreat offers a walk-in closet and a private full ensuite, creating your own little escape at the end of the day. Two additional bright bedrooms share another full bathroom, giving everyone space and privacy (and reducing the morning line-up)....Everyday living is made easier with a convenient main-floor laundry room, complete with a modern LG washer and dryer—because hauling baskets up and down stairs is overrated....Outside, the backyard is truly an extension of your living space. A fully fenced yard offers peace of mind, while the wooden deck and permanent pergola over the paved patio set the stage for al fresco dining, sunset lounging, or a quiet coffee before the day begins. The massive children’s play structure will make you very popular with the younger crowd....The basement offers a flexible space that can adapt as your life does—home office, gym, hobby room, or extra storage—it’s ready for whatever you need...A practical bonus: the double attached garage keeps your vehicles warm, your storage organized, and your snow shoveling time to a minimum....Set in the established community of Woodbine, this home enjoys a prime southwest location. You’re co nveniently close to the Ring Road, giving you easy commuting access around the city and a quick escape to the west and the mountains for weekend adventures. Adjacent to the community, Fish Creek Provincial Park offers endless nature trails, biking paths, and river views—so you can trade screen time for green time in just a few minutes...Tucked on a quiet, family-friendly crescent, with nearby schools, parks, major transit routes, and essential amenities, this is a home where everyday life becomes just a little more effortless—and a lot more enjoyable.

      "PublicRemarks": "Welcome to the Elliot by Broadview Homes, a thoughtfully designed new construction home located in the southeast Calgary community of Hotchkiss. Offering a functional layout with a main floor flex room, side entrance, upper-level bonus room, walk-in closets in every bedroom, and basement rough-ins for future development, this home is built to support both everyday living and long-term flexibility. Step inside from the covered front porch to a versatile front flex space, perfect for a home office, playroom, or quiet workspace. The main level features an open-concept design with a bright kitchen at the center, complete with a large island, ample cabinetry, and excellent flow into the dining area. The spacious great room is ideal for relaxing or entertaining, highlighted by an electric fireplace with stunning floor-to-ceiling tile detail that creates a striking focal point. A convenient powder room and a practical rear entry with a generous closet complete the main floor. The side entrance leads directly to the undeveloped basement, with rough-ins already in place, creating outstanding potential for future additional bedrooms, a home gym, or extended living space. Upstairs, the layout is both smart and family-friendly. Two secondary bedrooms, each with their own walk-in closet, are separated by a central bonus room that works beautifully as a media space, homework zone, or second lounge. A dedicated upper laundry room adds everyday convenience. The primary suite offers a private retreat with an oversized walk-in closet and a full ensuite. Located in Hotchkiss, one of Calgary’s newest master-planned communities, residents enjoy access to mountain views, expansive green spaces, and scenic boardwalk pathways surrounding a 30-acre wetland. With future parks, schools, and shopping planned nearby, plus quick access to Stoney Trail and Highway 22X, you’re only minutes from Seton, the YMCA, South Health Campus, and major amenities. An excellent opportunity to own a brand new B roadview home in SE Calgary, offering modern design, flexible living space, and future development potential. (31630028)",

      "PublicRemarks": "(    OPEN HOUSE  CANCELLED     )  Welcome to 3042–31A Street SE, a well-maintained property offering a functional layout that appeals to both homeowners and investors alike. Step inside the spacious main floor, where you’re greeted by gorgeous birch kitchen cabinetry that brings warmth and character to the home. The main level boasts an open, inviting floor plan with loads of countertop space and storage, plus a smart combination of durable ceramic tile flooring in the high-traffic areas and original oak hardwood in the bedrooms—adding charm and longevity. The main floor windows were upgraded to vinyl years ago, enhancing energy efficiency and comfort throughout. This level remains a fully functioning three-bedroom layout, though the third bedroom has been enhanced with a convenient door leading directly to the back deck, offering flexibility for outdoor access, home office potential, or multi-generational living.

      "PublicRemarks": "Introducing the beautifully crafted Lyall floor plan—where contemporary design meets everyday functionality in the growing southeast community of Hotchkiss. From the moment you step inside, the 10-foot main floor ceilings and wide plank luxury vinyl flooring set the tone for an inviting, open-concept layout that’s equal parts stylish and practical. At the front of the home, a flexible bonus room offers endless possibilities—whether you need a quiet office, a creative space, or a cozy reading nook. The heart of the home unfolds at the back, where a bright and spacious living area is anchored by an eye-catching kitchen. Thoughtfully finished with a mix of modern cabinetry and natural wood tones, it features quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, classic subway tile, and an oversized island with seating—perfect for casual breakfasts or hosting friends and family. The adjacent dining area easily accommodates large gatherings, making this home an entertainer’s dream. Upstairs, a central loft adds a second family space or media room, separating the primary retreat from the kids' rooms. The primary suite is a true escape, complete with a walk-in closet and spa-like ensuite with dual sinks, the perfect spot to start or end your day. Two additional bedrooms, a full 4-piece bath, and an upper laundry room complete the level with comfort and convenience. The side entrance provides options in the future for a basement suite (A secondary suite would be subject to approval and permitting by the city/municipality) providing the perfect spot for extended family or rental income. **This home also comes complete with full front and backyard landscaping, including sod, mulch on the side yards, and trees/shrubs in the front as per community guidelines. Hotchkiss is one of Calgary’s newest southeast communities, offering the perfect blend of quiet residential living and urban accessibility. With quick connections to Stoney Trail, 52nd Street, and the South Calgary Health Campus , commuting is a breeze. This growing neighbourhood features thoughtfully designed green spaces, winding walking paths, and future planned amenities including parks, schools, and local shops—all designed to create a connected and vibrant community atmosphere. Whether you're a first-time buyer, growing family, or savvy investor, Hotchkiss offers value, space, and the promise of long-term growth in a fresh new part of the city. This is more than just a home—it’s a chance to be part of something new and exciting. (31588356)",

      "PublicRemarks": "A FULL BEDROOM AND FULL BATHROOM ON THE MAIN FLOOR IS THE HEADLINE FEATURE HERE—AND IT’S A WINIt works equally well for guests, multigenerational living, or a proper home office that doesn’t take over shared space. It’s a choice that pays off immediately—and keeps paying off as life changes.The kitchen upgrades lean practical in the best way. FULL-HEIGHT CABINETRY means storage that actually works. QUARTZ COUNTERTOPS run throughout the home. A CHIMNEY-STYLE HOOD FAN with real airflow and a BUILT-IN MICROWAVE keep counters clear and sightlines clean. The ELECTRIC FIREPLACE is finished as a full-height feature wall—not a placeholder—giving the main living area a sense of completion and style. Upstairs, the CENTRAL BONUS ROOM does more than add square footage. It creates separation between the primary bedroom and the secondary bedrooms—something you’ll appreciate on busy mornings, quiet evenings, and everything in between. The primary bedroom adds a RAISED CEILING HEIGHT that brings noticeable volume, while laundry is upstairs, where it quietly saves time every week.The basement is unfinished, but not unplanned. A SEPARATE SIDE ENTRY, 9' foundation walls, a 200 AMP electrical panel, and ROUGH-INS FOR A FUTURE BATHROOM, SECOND LAUNDRY, AND BAR OR KITCHEN SINK mean fewer limitations and fewer expensive decisions down the road. This is groundwork you either have—or you don’t.Outside, the FRONT YARD IS SODDED and the 20' x 20' CONCRETE PARKING PAD is already done, keeping parking simple now and future garage plans straightforward.Located in Sora with quick access to Stoney Trail, parks, playgrounds, and growing amenities—and with QUICK POSSESSION AVAILABLE—this is a home that holds up under scrutiny. If you’re comparing homes closely, THIS IS ONE WORTH SEEING before you rule anything out. • PLEASE NOTE: Kitchen appliances are included, and will be installed prior to possession. (31522419)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Welcome to the brand new Concord II by Broadview Homes, a well-planned home offering a central loft, main floor flex room, side entrance, and generous pantry. Located in the southeast Calgary community of Hotchkiss, this home combines modern design with practical, everyday functionality. The main floor begins with a flexible front room that works well as a home office, playroom, or quiet workspace. The kitchen sits at the heart of the home, designed as a true gathering space with a 7’6” central island and a large pantry for added storage. The dining nook is positioned alongside the kitchen for easy flow, while the rear great room provides a comfortable space to relax, highlighted by an electric fireplace. A side entrance leads to the undeveloped basement, offering excellent flexibility for future development. Upstairs, a centrally located loft creates a versatile second living area ideal for movie nights, study space, or casual lounging. Two well-sized secondary bedrooms are complemented by a convenient upper laundry room and a large linen closet for everyday organization. The primary suite features a spacious walk-in closet and a private ensuite, providing a comfortable retreat. Hotchkiss offers a balance of natural surroundings and urban convenience, with mountain views, expansive green spaces, and boardwalk pathways surrounding a 30-acre wetland. Future community plans include parks, gathering spaces, schools, and retail amenities. Quick access to Stoney Trail and 22X makes it easy to reach shopping, the South Health Campus, the Seton YMCA, and more. This is an excellent opportunity to own a thoughtfully designed new home in one of southeast Calgary’s newest master-planned communities. (31513624)",

      "PublicRemarks": "If you’ve been searching for a brand-new home but don’t want to wait for construction, this is your chance. Be the first to call this beautifully designed, never-lived-in 3-bedroom home by Hopewell Residential your own. Offering nearly 1,400 sq. ft. of thoughtfully planned living space and a side entrance for a potential future basement suite (a secondary suite would be subject to approval and permitting by the city/municipality), this home blends style, function, and future flexibility. From the moment you step inside, the home feels bright and welcoming thanks to an abundance of windows and a desirable west-facing backyard that captures the afternoon and evening sun. The main floor is finished in luxury vinyl plank flooring throughout, creating a seamless, modern look that’s both durable and easy to maintain. An upgraded railing that carries up the staircase helps create an open, connected feel between the levels, enhancing the overall sense of space. The main floor is designed for everyday living and effortless entertaining. A separate living room and family room give you flexibility—whether you want a cozy TV space, a more formal sitting area, or a play area for the kids. The dedicated dining area is well-positioned between the kitchen and family room, making it ideal for family dinners, hosting friends, or gathering for those special holiday meals. At the heart of the home is the show-stopping kitchen. Here you’ll find white kitchen cabinets extended to the bulkhead, creating a clean, custom feel with extra vertical presence. These are paired with white quartz counters and a marble-style backsplash, giving the space a fresh, upscale look that will stand the test of time. Stainless steel appliances, a large central island, and generous cabinet and counter space ensure this kitchen is as functional as it is beautiful, whether you’re preparing weeknight meals or entertaining a crowd. Just off the main living area, a generous pocket office provides a quiet, dedicat ed space for working from home, managing household tasks, or serving as a homework zone for the kids. Upstairs, the layout continues to prioritize comfort and convenience. The spacious primary bedroom offers a calming retreat at the end of the day, complete with a stylish 4-piece ensuite featuring dual sinks & an oversized shower. Two additional well-sized bedrooms provide flexibility for kids, guests, or a home office, while the upper-floor laundry room adds everyday practicality. A full main bathroom completes the second level, making the upstairs space feel balanced and family-friendly. The side entrance opens up future opportunities to develop the basement into a suite (a secondary suite would be subject to approval & permitting by the city/municipality), creating potential for extended family living or rental income down the road. Outside, the home comes fully finished with front and backyard landscaping, including sod, mulch along the side yards. The Benning by Hopewell Residential delivers it all. (31505633)",

This property is ideal for buyers looking to renovate and personalize, while avoiding the expense and disruption of critical system replacements. Extensive upgrades include a new 4-inch ABS sewer line, new 1-inch main water supply line, upgraded 200-amp electrical service with a new electrical panel, and a new electric hot water tank—providing a solid foundation for future renovations.  A major highlight is the newly constructed oversized double attached garage, featuring a 12-foot overhead door with side-mounted motors. The garage has been wired for future EV chargers, welding equipment, TV and audio systems, or a golf simulator, making it an exceptional space for hobbyists, trades, or vehicle enthusiasts. Construction has also begun on a mudroom connecting the garage to the home, adding functionality and value.  The home includes a new roof on the addition and the rear portion of the house, further reducing future capital costs.  Architectural drawings have already been completed for an additional story, offering exciting potential for expansion and increased living space, subject to approvals.  With the heavy lifting already done, this property offers a rare chance to focus on cosmetic updates and design choices to create a modern home tailored to your vision. (31464865)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Attention Builders, Developers & Investors! Exceptional DP APPROVED for 4 UNITS, infill opportunity in Inglewood, one of Calgary’s most iconic and in-demand inner-city communities. Approved for a back-to-back duplex with two legal basement suites (4 units total), this project is truly shovel-ready. Utilities have been disconnected, the demolition permit is approved, and the interior of the existing home has already been stripped down to the studs — no asbestos remediation required. Build immediately and capitalize this season. Situated just 8 minutes from downtown, Inglewood is renowned for its vibrant character, strong rental demand, and long-term appreciation. The neighbourhood offers an unbeatable lifestyle with river pathways, parks, schools, breweries, boutiques, music venues, and some of Calgary’s top restaurants, all within walking distance. Easy access to transit and major roadways further enhances appeal for both end-users and tenants. This is a rare opportunity to develop in a high-barrier, mature inner-city location where new inventory is limited. Ideal for strong resale value, long-term rental hold, or investor exit, in a community that consistently outperforms. Don’t miss your chance to build in one of Calgary’s most established and sought-after neighbourhoods. (31462315)",

      "PublicRemarks": "SORA IS ONE OF SOUTHEAST CALGARY'S NEWEST NEIGHBOUHOODS, AND IT'S QUICKLY TAKING SHAPE — pathways, ponds, future green spaces, and easy access to Stoney Trail. This MOVE-IN READY detached two-storey puts your family right in the middle of that growth, without the wait of new construction.This 3-bed, 2.5-bath layout was designed for real family life, not just pretty photos. You get a bright WEST-FACING front yard, a 20' x 20' rear concrete parking pad, a bonus room for movie nights (or sibling separation), upstairs laundry, and even a MAIN FLOOR POCKET OFFICE that gives you a dedicated work zone without sacrificing the open-concept feel. The kitchen brings the upgrades that matter — quartz countertops, 48\" UPPERS, a chimney hood fan, BUILT-IN MICROWAVE, and an UPGRADED SILGRANIT SINK — while the living room centers around a clean, MODERN ELECTRIC FIREPLACE. With 9' CEILINGS on both the main floor and basement, everything feels open, light, and easy to live in.The basement is prepped for future growth with 9' foundation walls, a separate side entrance, an 80-GALLON HOT WATER TANK, bathroom rough-ins, laundry rough-ins, and a sink rough-in. Whether you’re dreaming of extra living space or a zone teenagers can disappear into, the groundwork is already in place.And here’s the long-game benefit: as Sora continues to develop — with new amenities, gathering spaces, and everyday conveniences on the horizon — early homeowners are often the first to see that value build. Combine that with fast access to major routes, South Health Campus, and the Seton YMCA, and you’ve got a location that balances breathing room with urban convenience.If your family’s been craving more space, more privacy, and a foothold in a growing neighbourhood, this home is ready when you are.Let’s go take a look — you’ll see what I mean the moment you walk in. • PLEASE NOTE: Photos are of a finished Showhome of the same model – fit and finish may differ on finished spec home.

The main floor features an older updated kitchen,  4 piece bathroom, three  bedrooms with a very generous sized master as well as a very large open dining/living room. The basement is partially finished with a den and the family room has a wood burning fireplace. The area has mature trees, and the back yard has plenty of room to build an oversized double car garage with a secondary suite above it. (\"A secondary suite would be subject to approval and permitting by the city/municipality.\") The side drive way would give access to the garage or back lane access. Great location here. Close to the new ring road as well as schools, shopping, Southland Leisure Centre, transit, and other amenities. (31373425)",

Due to unforeseen circumstances the interior repaint was started but never completed. Excellent opportunity for the new owner to build instant equity by completing the painting and doing some minor finishing.  The large second level kitchen has a walk in pantry and comes complete with appliances and has a 11' 9\" X 9' 0\" covered balcony for enjoyment.  For that in home office person there is a good sized den or if needed a fourth bedroom on the upper level.  Good sized West facing rear yard that is  fenced  with a shed for your lawn equipment and parking pad for your cars.   The home is located in the family community of  McKenzie Towne and is close to schools, shopping and public transportation.  Great value here. (31372546)",
