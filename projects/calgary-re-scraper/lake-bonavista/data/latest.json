The primary bedroom has a 5pc ensuite (jetted tub + steam shower) + a large walk-in closet. These owners have consistently maintained & updated their home as needed. Other recent updates include: Attic insulation top up (R60), new kitchen backsplash, under-mount kitchen lighting, new fans and light fixtures in all bathrooms, primary closet refresh, Hunter Douglas blinds in the living room, new paint & more.  ||   ||  THE FLOOR PLAN: This was originally a 4 bedroom up plan that was converted to 3. This allows for a larger ensuite & primary closet which is hard to find in Lake Bonavista. Upper laundry was also added which is convenient for families. The main floor has the best of both worlds. Open, bright & inviting, & a quiet flex room on the opposite side that can be used as an office/family room. The basement has a huge, 4th bedroom. Ideal for a nanny or teenager. Full bath, flex spaces & storage area complete the basement. ||    ||  THE BACKYARD: Large, south facing & low maintenance yard that walks out from the kitchen. Huge, high quality composite deck, low maintenance artificial turf, & oversized 26x24 garage with dedicated electrical panel.  You’ll be hard pressed to find a better yard. Beautiful “Spring in snow” tree in the back corner blooms fragrant & white, & a Manitoba maple that provides amazing shade.  ||  ||  Family friendly street & neighbours: The current owners say: “The best neighbours!

      "PublicRemarks": "A thoughtfully, well-designed two-storey home with numerous improvements and upgrades is now available in the very desirable SE community of Bonavista Downs. This is a unique home in that it features two garages. The first is a front-facing, single (21’x12’), attached, insulated and heated garage with upgraded wiring, and finished interior which includes shelving. The front rubber-paved driveway offers additional parking. The second is an oversized double (25’ x 28’), heated, detached garage accessed from the paved alley, and has a finished interior which includes shelving, cabinets, and a workbench and is wired for 220 volts. Three bedrooms, 3.5 baths and 2,250 sq. ft. of living space on three levels. Upon entering the tiled foyer, the natural light flowing in from the upgraded triple pane windows on all sides is remarkable.  Motorized window blinds allow you to control the light factor. The main floor is comprised of living room, dining room and kitchen and has warm hard wood floors throughout. To the left is the living room with woodburning, stone surround fireplace and enough space to experiment with various furniture configurations. The rear deck is accessed via French doors in the living room. To the right of the foyer is the dining room with ample room for entertainment and is adjacent to the kitchen. Cream cabinetry and plenty of it in the kitchen is a beautiful contrast to the dark granite countertops and tiled backsplash. Gleaming stainless appliances and a pantry add to the efficiency. A 2-pc. bath completes the main level. Moving upstairs, there is a combination of hardwood and laminate flooring. The primary bedroom is large and sunny with the benefit of a newly added walk-through closet and 4-pc. ensuite (double vanity). Two additional bedrooms, both with generous-sized closets, share a 4-pc. bath. The basement has been attractively finished and features a large, carpeted rec room with a second woodburning fireplace (both fireplaces passed WETT inspecti on in 2023). Across from the rec room is a tiled home office and tucked back of that is the laundry room with upgraded plumbing, venting and wiring; storage area and an upgraded 3-pc. bath. The house, attached garage and detached garage all have well-insulated (R40) attics. In 2023 the furnace was upgraded to a high-efficiency model with smart thermostat, a tankless water heater was installed and the humidifier was replaced. Both front and back yards are landscaped with lawn and mature trees. The back yard is fenced and has sprinklers installed. A bonus is your own hot tub. Well situated and close to Stoney, Deerfoot and Macleod Trails and Anderson Road. Proximity to shops and restaurants on both Macleod Trail and 130th Avenue; the Bow River; numerous schools (public and Catholic); churches; playgrounds; dog parks; Fish Creek Provincial Park and South Health Campus. This home has obviously been well tended as evidenced by the many upgrades and enhancements. Don't miss out on this outstanding opportunity. (31571312)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Set quietly against the untouched beauty of Fish Creek Park, this estate offers something increasingly rare in the city: space, privacy, and the freedom to finish a remarkable home in your own vision. With 4 beds, 3.5 bath and over 5,650 sq. ft. of thoughtfully updated living space, the heavy lifting has already been done. The kitchen is designed for gathering—solid maple cabinetry, updated countertops, and professional-grade appliances including a Wolf gas cooktop, Sub-Zero fridge, and Miele steam, convection, and microwave ovens. It’s timeless and functional. The dining room sits just beyond, ideal for both everyday meals and hosting, while the living room is anchored by a double-sided wood-burning fireplace with gas ignition that is shared exclusively with the adjoining office/den—creating a cozy, light-filled space for both relaxing and working with the park as your backdrop.Upstairs, the primary suite feels calm and private, framed by treetop views and direct access to a newly built balcony—an ideal place for slow mornings and quiet evenings. Bathrooms throughout the home have been redesigned with premium materials, custom vanities, updated fixtures and lighting, and Turkish marble tile. Even the laundry room has been refreshed with custom cabinetry, stone counters, a sink, and a convenient laundry chute.The walkout lower level offers flexibility rather than definition. A custom bar finished with Spanish tile and granite countertops sets the tone for entertaining, while open spaces invite whatever comes next—gym, games room, studio, or guest retreat.And then there’s the backyard.West-facing and backing directly onto Fish Creek Park, it feels like a summer fairytale. Long evenings by the pool, laughter drifting through the trees, golden light filtering through the branches. The heated pool has been upgraded and is ready for warm days and barefoot nights. DuraDeck balconies with glass railings extend your living space outdoors, while city-maintained pathways  just beyond your gate invite year-round walks, bike rides, and moments of calm.Behind the scenes, key systems have been upgraded, including a serviced commercial-grade boiler, new air conditioning, updated plumbing, refreshed lighting, and epoxy-coated garage and mechanical rooms. The structure is strong, the setting unmatched. Step into one of Calgary’s most coveted natural backdrops and shape the final details around your own lifestyle.A place where summers feel endless, mornings are quieter, and the park becomes part of everyday life.

No expense was spared in this top-to-bottom renovation, offering 1,738 square feet of finished living space.  The main floor is a showstopper, featuring an open concept layout with gorgeous hardwood flooring and a custom kitchen. The culinary space boasts sleek navy and white cabinetry, a large central island, quartz countertops, a classic farmhouse sink, and a unique hexagonal tile transition that seamlessly blends the kitchen and dining areas.
